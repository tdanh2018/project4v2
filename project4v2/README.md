Group Project 3 - Movie Analysis

The visualizations contained within the API and Database folders can be viewed as follows:

Open the Database folder, access and run the data within the pandas notebook data.ipynb
Once the data has been run, open a python server using the app.py

Next, navigate to the API folder, run the index.html file open as a live server. 

With both actions complete all visualizations will be viewable and you will be able to go between all pages on the html.
